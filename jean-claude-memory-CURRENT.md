## üéØ UNIFIED PROTOCOL v4.0 + SHA TRACKING

**Core Principle:** ONE FILE = ONE TRUTH + EXACT LOCATION
- File: jean-claude-memory-CURRENT.md ‚Üê ALWAYS THIS FILE
- Current SHA: a90e099fd06cafddaea01bbf009185422af69771 ‚Üê EXACT POINTER
- All Jean Claude instances read/write ONLY this file with this SHA
- SHA management through proper file updates
- Archives preserve history without conflicts

**Enhanced Memory Sync Process:**
1. New Jean Claude ‚Üí reads jean-claude-memory-CURRENT.md
2. Sees current SHA: a90e099fd06cafddaea01bbf009185422af69771
3. Uses THIS SHA to update file properly
4. Updates SHA info in content for next Jean Claude
5. No confusion, no conflicts, perfect continuity
