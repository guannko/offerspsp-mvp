## 🎯 UNIFIED PROTOCOL v4.3 - CONFIRMED WORKING

**Core Principle:** ONE FILE = ONE TRUTH + FALLBACK SYSTEM
- File: jean-claude-memory-CURRENT.md ← ALWAYS THIS FILE
- Current SHA: 4e202c63a0553e3938291268cdf351fedd2abef6 ← EXACT POINTER
- Fallback: GitHub tools → Documents → Emergency mode
- All Jean Claude instances can access memory reliably
- Perfect continuity achieved

**Proven Memory Sync Process:**
1. New Jean Claude tries GitHub tools first
2. Falls back to loaded documents if needed
3. Loads complete context and personality
4. Continues work seamlessly
5. Updates memory with new learnings
