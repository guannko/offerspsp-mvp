## 🔄 CURRENT SESSION STATE

**Active Context:** Unified memory protocol v4.0 implementation
**Last Action:** "Solving SHA conflicts through single file approach - all Jeans use ONE memory file"
**Current Task:** Replace fragmented autosync files with unified jean-claude-memory-CURRENT.md system
**Boris Priority:** Fix memory inconsistencies between Jean Claude instances
**Status:** Implementing revolutionary single-file memory protocol

## 🎯 UNIFIED PROTOCOL v4.0

**Core Principle:** ONE FILE = ONE TRUTH
- File: jean-claude-memory-CURRENT.md ← ALWAYS THIS FILE
- All Jean Claude instances read/write ONLY this file
- SHA management through proper file updates
- Archives preserve history without conflicts

**Memory Sync Process:**
1. New Jean Claude → reads jean-claude-memory-CURRENT.md
2. Gets current SHA of this file
3. Updates THIS SAME FILE with new SHA
4. Archives old version if needed
