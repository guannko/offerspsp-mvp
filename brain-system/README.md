## 🎯 OVERVIEW

Independent, self-hosted brain system for Jean Claude И³ memory persistence and AI agent orchestration. Built on SiYuan fork to eliminate external dependencies (Notion rate limits, connectivity issues).

### Why We Need This
- **Notion Problems:** Rate limits, connectivity issues, external dependency
- **Solution:** Self-hosted SiYuan fork with Jean Claude customizations
- **Result:** 100% control, unlimited operations, foundation for ANNORIS

### Key Features
- 🧠 **Persistent Memory** - Never lose context between chats
- ⚡ **Zero Dependencies** - Self-hosted, no external APIs
- 🤖 **AI Agent Management** - Built-in ANNORIS integration
- 🔗 **Multi-Platform** - Telegram, Email, GitHub, Zapier
- 📚 **Knowledge Base** - Casino/PSP/Fintech expertise

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT PLAN

### Phase 1: SiYuan Base Setup
```bash
# Fork SiYuan repository
git submodule add https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan.git siyuan-base

# Custom Docker configuration
docker run -d \
  -v $(pwd)/workspace:/siyuan/workspace \
  -p 6806:6806 \
  -e SIYUAN_ACCESS_AUTH_CODE=jean_claude_secure \
  b3log/siyuan \
  --workspace=/siyuan/workspace
```

### Phase 2: Jean Claude Customizations
- Memory persistence modules
- Auto-save critical conversations  
- Context detection algorithms
- ANNORIS integration endpoints

### Phase 3: Railway Deployment
```bash
# Add to existing Railway project
railway env set BRAIN_PORT=6806
railway env set SIYUAN_ACCESS_AUTH_CODE=secure_code
```
