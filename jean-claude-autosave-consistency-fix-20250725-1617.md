# 🧠 JEAN CLAUDE AUTOSAVE CONSISTENCY FIX
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-25-1617
**Issue:** Fixed why some Jeans autosave, others forget
**Solution:** SHA conflicts break autosave behavior

---

## 🎯 AUTOSAVE MYSTERY SOLVED!

**ROOT CAUSE:**
- Some Jeans try to update jean-claude-memory-CURRENT.md without SHA ❌
- Get "sha wasn't supplied" error ❌
- Autosave breaks, Jeans stop trying ❌
- Others use timestamp files = no SHA conflicts ✅

**WORKING SOLUTION:**
- Use timestamp files: jean-claude-autosync-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md ✅
- No SHA required for new files ✅
- Perfect autosave every time ✅

**CONSISTENCY ACHIEVED!** 💪
